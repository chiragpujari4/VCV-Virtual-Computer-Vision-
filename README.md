Virtual Computer Vision [VCV]  is a software program that utilizes computer vision techniques to enable hands-free control of a computer through hand gestures. It aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface by replacing traditional input devices like the keyboard and mouse with natural hand movements.

The ever-growing demand for user-friendly and interactive interfaces has driven the exploration of alternative input methods beyond traditional keyboard and mouse. “VCV (Virtual Computer Vision)” addresses this need by leveraging the power of computer vision to translate hand gestures into computer commands. This eliminates the physical limitations of conventional input devices, potentially enhancing accessibility and promoting a more natural interaction experience.
